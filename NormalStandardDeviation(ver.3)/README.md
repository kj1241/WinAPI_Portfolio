# Normal Distribution-Based Personnel Allocation Program

## Overview

The Normal Distribution-Based Personnel Allocation Program is a powerful tool designed to enhance efficiency in personnel allocation through statistical methods and data visualization. By leveraging the principles of normal distribution, the program provides optimal allocation solutions and intuitive, user-friendly graphical interfaces implemented with WinAPI. It also includes simplified data extraction features to support diverse practical applications.

## Key Features

### 1. C++-Based Simulation
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Allocates personnel to specified coordinates based on a normal distribution model.
- **Accurate Calculations:** Utilizes the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for precise range calculations.
- **Data Export Options:** Outputs results in XML and Excel formats for in-depth analysis.

### 2. Graph Visualization with WinAPI
- **Graph Implementation:** Visualizes normal distribution graphs using WinAPI Line functions.
- **Bar Graph Support:** Highlights specific data ranges as bar graphs for improved readability.

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Intuitive Input Interface:** Provides user-friendly input buttons created with WinAPI.
- **Automated Data Saving:** Simplifies the process of generating and saving Excel files.
